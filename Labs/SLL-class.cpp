Implementing a singly linked list with functions only. The list of functions in this __file__ includes:
1. void insert(head, value, position) --> To insert nodes into the singly linked list (SLL) at the specified position. 
2. void remove(head, position)        --> To remove a node given the position of the Node. 
3. (get a return type of a pointer) Node* search(head, target)         --> To search for a Node given its value 
4. void reverse(head)                 --> To reverse a SLL 
5. void replace(head, value, position) --> To replace the value of a node, given where it is present. 
6. void print(head)                    --> To print the results.
